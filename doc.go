// Package hugot provides a simple interface for building extensible
// chat bots in an idiomatic go style. It is heavily influenced by
// net/http, and uses an internal message format that is compatible
// with Slack messages.
//
// Adapters
//
// Adapters are used to integrate with external chat systems. Currently
// the following adapters exist:
//   slack - github.com/tcolgate/hugot/adapters/slack - for https://slack.com/
//   shell - github.com/tcolgate/hugot/adapters/shell - simple readline based adapter
//
// Handlers
//
// Handlers process messages. There are a several built in handler types:
//
// RawHandlers will execute for every message sent to them.
//
// HearsHandlers will execute for any message which matches a given regular
// expression. They are passed all string sub-matches from any capture groups.
//
// Command Handlers act on any direct message. Message are attempted to be
// processed as a command line. Quoted text is handle as a single argument. The
// passed message can be used as a flag.FlagSet
//
// Background handlers, are started when the bot is started. They do not
// receive messages but can send them. They are intended to implement long
// lived background tasks that react to external inputs.
//
// HTTP handlers can be used to implement web hooks by adding the bot to a
// http.ServeMux. A URL is build from the name of the handler.
//
// Mux
//
// The Mux, and CommandMux will multiple message across a set of handlers. In
// addition, a top level "help" Command handler is added to provide help on
// usage of the various handlers added to it.
//
// WARNING: the interface is new and is subject to change. In particular, the Comman/CommandMux
// code is overly complex and the interface may be simplified to make this easier to use.
// The HTTP support is currently unused and the interface may change depending on experience
// of actually using it.
